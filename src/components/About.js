            The past ten years, I have been working as a commercial real estate appraiser. Before that, I attended Vermont Law School where I studied environmental law and received a JD and Master of Environmental Law and Policy. My undergraduate education took place at the University of Georgia where I majored in English with a minor in History and a specialization in Medieval Studies. My strengths in all of these subjects are centered in skills surrounding reading, writing, editing, language, and research. In 2022, I completed the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I learned MERN stack development. While not applying directly, my previous experience demonstrates expertise at research, parsing dense documentation, and attention to detail - all beneficial skills for development.
